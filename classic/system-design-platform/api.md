# API Design

API (Application Programming Interface) design is central to system interoperability, scalability, and developer experience. This section covers practical strategies, examples, and checklists for robust API design.

## Core API Principles

### 1. RESTful APIs
- Use resource-oriented URIs, standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and status codes.
- Stateless, cacheable, and layered architecture.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] All endpoints use nouns (not verbs)
	- [ ] Consistent use of HTTP status codes
	- [ ] Pagination for list endpoints
	- [ ] See [Roy Fielding’s Dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)

### 2. OpenAPI/Swagger
- Document APIs with machine-readable specs for code generation and testing.
- Enables auto-generated docs and client SDKs.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] All endpoints documented in OpenAPI spec
	- [ ] Example requests and responses included
	- [ ] Versioning strategy documented
	- [ ] See [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/)

### 3. Consistency
- Use plural nouns for resources, predictable nesting, and versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/users`).
- Consistent error format and envelope (see [RFC 7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807)).

### 4. Security
- Use HTTPS everywhere, validate input, and require authentication/authorization (JWT, OAuth2).
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention.

## Example Endpoints
- `/api/auth/*` — login, register, reset
- `/api/catalog/*` — list, detail, search
- `/api/enrollments/*` — enroll, status
- `/api/progress/*` — update, fetch
- `/api/quizzes/*` — submit, grade
- `/api/forums/*` — threads, posts
- `/api/payments/*` — initiate, verify

## Service Communication

### 1. Synchronous
- Use HTTP/gRPC for core flows requiring immediate feedback.
- Prefer gRPC for internal service-to-service calls for performance.

### 2. Asynchronous
- Use message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for background tasks, notifications, and decoupling services.
- Enables resilience and scalability for non-blocking operations.

## Actionable Checklist
- [ ] All APIs are versioned
- [ ] Input validation and output sanitization in place
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention enabled
- [ ] Automated tests for all endpoints
- [ ] API documentation is up to date
