# System Design Principles

Foundational principles for designing robust, scalable, and maintainable systems, with practical examples and checklists.

## Core Principles

### 1. CAP Theorem
- In a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
- **Example:** NoSQL databases often choose AP (Availability, Partition Tolerance) over Consistency.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] Document which two guarantees your system prioritizes
	- [ ] Communicate trade-offs to stakeholders
	- [ ] See [CAP Theorem Explained](https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/)

### 2. Consistency vs. Availability
- Understand trade-offs and choose based on business needs.
- **Example:** Banking systems prioritize consistency; social feeds may prioritize availability.

### 3. Scalability
- Design to handle growth in users, data, and traffic. Use horizontal scaling, statelessness, and partitioning.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] System can scale horizontally
	- [ ] Stateless services where possible
	- [ ] Partitioning/sharding strategy documented

### 4. Fault Tolerance
- Build for failure. Use redundancy, retries, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.
- **Example:** Use bulkheads and circuit breakers to isolate failures.

### 5. Modularity
- Break systems into independent, loosely coupled components for easier maintenance and evolution.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] Each module/service has a single responsibility
	- [ ] Clear API boundaries between modules

### 6. Observability
- Make systems measurable and diagnosable with logs, metrics, and tracing.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] Centralized logging and metrics
	- [ ] Distributed tracing for microservices

### 7. Idempotency
- Ensure repeated operations have the same effect as one (important for APIs and distributed systems).
- **Example:** Payment APIs should be idempotent to avoid double charges.

### 8. Security by Design
- Integrate security at every layer (authentication, authorization, encryption, validation).
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
	- [ ] RBAC enforced for all admin actions

### 9. Automation
- Automate testing, deployment, and recovery for reliability and speed.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] CI/CD pipelines in place
	- [ ] Automated rollback on failure

### 10. Cost Awareness
- Design for efficiency and monitor cloud/resource usage.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] Cost monitoring and alerting enabled
	- [ ] Regular cost reviews

## Practical Checklist
- [ ] Define clear SLAs and SLOs
- [ ] Document failure modes and recovery plans
- [ ] Use version control and CI/CD
- [ ] Monitor and alert on key metrics
- [ ] Regularly review and refactor architecture
