# Diagrams

Visual diagrams are essential for communicating system architecture, data flows, and component interactions. Use standardized notation and keep diagrams up to date with system changes.

## Component Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
  User --> Web
  Web --> API
  API --> AuthService
```

## Best Practices
- Use clear, consistent symbols and labels.
- Show only relevant details for the intended audience (e.g., high-level for execs, detailed for engineers).
- Keep diagrams versioned alongside code/docs.
