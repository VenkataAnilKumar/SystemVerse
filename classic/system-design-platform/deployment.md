# CI/CD & Deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential for delivering reliable software at scale. This section covers practical strategies, examples, and checklists for robust deployment.

## CI (Continuous Integration)
- Automate linting, testing, and building on every commit. Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
- Run unit, integration, and end-to-end (e2e) tests. [See: Google Testing Blog](https://testing.googleblog.com/)
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] All code changes trigger automated builds
	- [ ] Linting and static analysis in CI pipeline
	- [ ] Tests run on every pull request

## CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)
- Automate deployment to staging and production environments. Use ArgoCD, Spinnaker, or Jenkins pipelines.
- Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for repeatable, auditable deployments.
- **Checklist:**
	- [ ] Deployments are automated and repeatable
	- [ ] Rollbacks can be triggered automatically
	- [ ] Staging and production environments are as similar as possible

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue/Green Deployments
- Deploy new version alongside old, switch traffic after validation. Enables instant rollback.

### 2. Rolling Deployments
- Gradually replace old instances with new ones. Minimizes downtime.

### 3. Canary Releases
- Release to a small subset of users before full rollout.

## Best Practices
- Monitor deployments and roll back on failure.
- Use feature flags for safe releases.
- Keep environments as similar as possible (dev â‰ˆ prod).
- Document all deployment steps and rollback procedures.

## Actionable Checklist
- [ ] All deployments are logged and auditable
- [ ] Feature flags used for risky changes
- [ ] Automated health checks post-deployment
- [ ] Rollback tested regularly
