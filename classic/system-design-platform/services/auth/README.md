# Auth Service (Reference)

Minimal reference authentication service (stateless JWT-based) for the System Design Platform.

Purpose:
- Provide signup, login, token refresh, and password reset endpoints.

This is a scaffold â€” pick a language (Node/Express, Python/Flask) and implement following the OpenAPI spec in `openapi.yaml`.

Testing: include unit tests for auth flows and an integration test that verifies token issuance.
