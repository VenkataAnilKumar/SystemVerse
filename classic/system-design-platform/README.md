Welcome to the System Design Platform (Classic). This project is a comprehensive, theory-driven guide to designing scalable, maintainable, and robust software systems. It is intended for engineers, architects, and students who want to master the art and science of system design.

## Project Goals
- Provide a modular, reference-quality set of documents covering all major aspects of system design.
- Serve as a learning and interview preparation resource, as well as a practical guide for real-world projects.
- Link to authoritative references, industry standards, and best practices throughout.

## Structure
## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside


## How to Use
1. Start with `requirements.md` to understand the problem space and constraints.
2. Study `architecture.md` and `patterns.md` for proven approaches and trade-offs.
3. Use `database.md` and `api.md` for implementation details and interface design.
4. Reference `deployment.md` and `cloud.md` for operationalizing your system.
5. Use `diagrams.md` for visual summaries.
