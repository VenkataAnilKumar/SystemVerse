# Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system should do. They are derived from user needs, business goals, and domain analysis. For a modern education or learning platform, typical functional requirements include:

- **User authentication:** Secure sign up, login, and password reset. Use industry standards like OAuth2 and store passwords with strong hashing (e.g., bcrypt). [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- **User profile management:** Allow users to update personal info, preferences, and privacy settings.
- **Course/catalog management:** CRUD operations for courses, search, filtering, and recommendations. Consider faceted search and full-text indexing (see [Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html)).
- **Enrollment:** Support both free and paid enrollments, with transactional integrity.
- **Progress tracking:** Track user progress at module/lesson granularity. Store as event logs or summary tables for analytics.
- **Quizzes and assignments:** Auto/manual grading, plagiarism detection, and feedback loops. [See: Designing Data-Intensive Applications, Ch. 10]
- **Discussion forums:** Threaded discussions per module, moderation tools, and notifications.
- **Payments and subscriptions:** Integrate with PCI-compliant providers (Stripe, PayPal). Handle edge cases (refunds, chargebacks).
- **Admin panel:** Role-based access for managing users, content, and analytics.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define system qualities and constraints. They are critical for real-world success and often drive architectural decisions.

- **High availability:** Design for 99.9%+ uptime. Use redundancy, failover, and health checks. [Google SRE Book, Ch. 21]
- **Low latency:** Aim for sub-200ms response times for user actions. Use caching, CDNs, and async processing.
- **Fault tolerance:** Graceful degradation, retries, and circuit breakers. [Release It! by Michael Nygard]
- **Security:** Follow OWASP Top 10, encrypt sensitive data, and use RBAC. [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- **Monitoring & observability:** Collect metrics, logs, and traces. Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
- **Scalability:** Design to handle 10x user spikes. Use horizontal scaling, stateless services, and partitioning.
- **Maintainability:** Modular, testable codebase. Use CI/CD, code reviews, and automated testing.
