![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)


Welcome to the **Classic** section of SystemVerse! This is your comprehensive, open, and modular resource for mastering system design fundamentals, principles, and real-world case studies.


## Overview

**Folders:**
- `system-design-platform/`: Modern system design theory, architecture, patterns, databases, APIs, deployment, cloud, diagrams, 20+ real-world case studies, interview prep, ADRs, tooling, and glossary.
- `object-oriented-design/`: Object-Oriented Analysis & Design, UML, 15+ classic case studies, Python code, and diagrams.


SystemVerse Classic is organized into two major parts:

- **System Design Platform**: Everything you need to master modern system design‚Äîrequirements, architecture, patterns, databases, APIs, deployment, cloud, diagrams, 20+ real-world case studies, interview prep, and more.
- **Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD)**: Deep dive into object-oriented design, UML, and 15+ classic case studies (ATM, Chess, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) with Python code and diagrams.

---

## Who is this for?

- Students and engineers preparing for system design or OOD interviews
- Professionals building or scaling real-world systems
- Anyone seeking a deep, practical understanding of system design and OOAD

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap & Tech Stack

**Implementation Roadmap:**
1. **MVP (Monolith/Modular):** Auth, user, catalog, enrollment, progress, quiz, forum, payment modules; REST API, PostgreSQL, Redis, CDN, Docker
2. **Add Observability:** Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting
3. **Asynchronous Workflows:** Message queue for notifications, grading
4. **Scale Out:** Split into microservices as needed (start with Enrollment, Payment, Forum)
5. **Cloud Deployment:** Containerize, deploy to Kubernetes, use managed DB/cache
6. **CI/CD Automation:** Automated tests, builds, deployments

**Suggested Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express/NestJS) or Python (FastAPI), gRPC for internal comms
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB (for forums/search)
- **Caching:** Redis, CDN (Cloudflare/AWS CloudFront)
- **Streaming/Messaging:** RabbitMQ or Kafka
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana

**Trade-offs & Alternatives:**
- **Monolith vs. Microservices:** Monolith is simpler for MVP, easier to test/deploy. Microservices add complexity but scale better for large teams/features.
- **SQL vs. NoSQL:** SQL for strong consistency and relationships. NoSQL for flexible, high-volume data (forums, analytics).
- **REST vs. GraphQL:** REST is simple and well-supported. GraphQL offers flexible queries but adds complexity.
- **Cloud-native vs. On-prem:** Cloud-native is faster to scale, easier to manage, but can be more expensive.
